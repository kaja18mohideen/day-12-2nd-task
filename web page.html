            Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, commonly known as Periyar, was a social reformer and politician from India. He was a staunch advocate for social justice, self-respect, and rationalism. Periyar played a crucial role in the Dravidian movement and worked towards eradicating caste-based discrimination and promoting gender equality.

            He is best known for his efforts in challenging traditional social norms, advocating for the rights of marginalized communities, and fighting against the oppressive caste system. Periyar's work and ideas continue to influence the socio-political landscape of South India.

            This web page is a tribute to the life and legacy of Periyar, who dedicated his life to the betterment of society.
